Holy f**c, I wasn't expecting to post something until the next week but things are moving very rapidly. 

Yesterday, at the twilight of the day, OpenAI made an announcement that seems to be huge, really huge. *"The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500B over the next four years building new AI infrestructure for OpenAI and USA"* mainly developing data centers and its respective energy supplies. 

Well, yesterday I've share some views about Sam Altman and it is true that most of AI stuff are marketing, however, this is a enourmous step in the direction to AGI, or at least advancing at levels humanity have not ever seen.
We'll see how much it takes to be built, it already started in Texas and it is planned to expand around all American territory.

The initial funding and technology partners are OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, MGX, Arm, Microsoft and NVIDIA. So it looks like a common effort to advance in the technologic run. One thing that caught my attention is that despite the fact that the majority of the technology industry is supporting this project in conjunction with the recently assumed American government, which highlights the fact that Elon Musk is part of this government and has an open war against Altman and what represents OpenAI today.

Even they had a beef in the comments of the official announcement post where Musk was questioning the source or the veracity of the project's fundings and Altman limited himselft just to answer sarcastically or denying Musk's claimings. So it is very notable that one of today most influential advisers of President Trump does not support probably the biggest investment in technology the world has ever seen.
The point of the funding sources is remarkable due to it is a huge amount of money, and we all know Trump is not one of those who most enjoys reducing public spending. Although if for any reason the funding ends up being public, it could be seriously questionable, like the donations to finance some wars were. And don't be confused, there is zero chance I compare developing AI with make wars but what I mean is that this project is self claiming as a private funding project and I love the tech/acc as a state policy but I would be foolish if I do not recognice there are so much stuff people need to chance or improve in order to be a society focused in conquer the stars and live in a complete different world. Politics must be eradicated as well as the collective effort as INDIVIDUALS must be centered in other things than evolve. 

I think I got carried away, I'll explains this vision in a later post, let's come back to Stargate.

In the conference, the company said *"We want to connect with companies across the entire landscape of built data center infrastructure, from energy and construction land to equipment and everything in between; What we want to do is what we can maintain in this country. China is a competitor, others are competitors. We want to be in this country and we are doing everything possible"* and there is a big focus on use AI in order to find out cures to many deceases including cancer, that's pretty beautiful, because doubling the life expentance or "inmortality" would not be so far from that point once archieved.

In the other hand, I believe the efforts of Milei for meeting with many technology companies CEOs in order to attract them to invest and build infraestructure in Argentina now will be a little in vain (I really hopes it isn't) but the Trump's policies of *"America First"* and seeing that most American companies jave agreed that, it makes it very difficult for Milei's and my dreams. But once taxes are lowered, we have the potential to take advantage of this opportunity for ourselves.

Here we don't have something Americans have developed long time ago, and it is ambition, the abitily of believe we can create thing beyond our reach, we must innove.

This post ended up being a mix salad but interesting in some way, as I say in every post, we can speculate many thing at an announcement but conclutions will emerge eventually things are done. In addition if there is something that changes my mind of proves me wrong I'll have to admit it.

I will continue to see what happens in the project and thus clarify this medley more, take care everyone.
