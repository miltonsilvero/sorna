If there is one of the things that has interested me the most internally, it has been nuclear energy. What for some is a taboo, for humanity at least in the next 50 years, can and should be one of the pillars of technological development and human expansion.

It is for this reason that I was pleasantly surprised by the announcement of the Argentine Nuclear Plan, and I hope that it will finally emerge as a strong policy within the Nation, above all, because there has already been a Nuclear Plan in the 50s but in addition to being insufficient, it was anything but efficient.

### *What happened to the previous ANP?*
One Saturday in 1951, Juan Domingo Perón commented to journalists accredited at the Casa Rosada  *"thermonuclear reactions have been achieved under controlled conditions on a technical scale"*, referring to the fact that the Austrian Ronald Richter had discovered a way to produce cheap and efficient  energnd unlimited energy in an atomic plant near San Carlos de Bariloche.

If this was correct, the country was going to be ahead of the world powers which in the post-war context were dedicated day and night to the advancement of nuclear research. 
This announcement was taken unkindly by Argentine society, which upon hearing *"nuclear"* revived in their minds the recent memories of what the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs have produced. 
The project began to demand a lot of expenses and the progress of the announcement never appeared, until José Antonio Balseiro (whom the name of the prestigious Institute comes) wrote *"although it weighed heavily on him, there was no serious scientific basis for Dr. Richter's statements"*. 

Finally, the latter met with Perón who informed him of the cancellation of the project.
Later governments decided to begin the construction of nuclear power plants in the country once the technology had already been developed and tested abroad. So today we have two PHRW (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) Atucha I and II reactors and one CANDU (Canadian Deuterium Uranium) type. All use heavy water as a moderator and coolant, and natural uranium as fuel. And Atucha III is currently under construction, which would use enriched uranium as fuel and light water as a coolant.

Something that unfortunately characterizes Argentina is that in almost any field that is a pioneer it must first catch up. Throughout history, on average, what was *"avant-garde"* was that which had a few years of development advantage over its competitors; it was not necessarily about inventing the new thing of the moment but about possessing that difference and be ahead. And the issue here is that if the country wants to be at the forefront, it must first catch up on many subjects, in some even where there are delays of about 25 years.

Something that gives confidence is that, for the moment, the head of the project is Demian Reidel, a physicist and economist trained at the aforementioned Balseiro Institute; appointed as Chief of Advisors to the President. A brilliant guy and, above all, visionary. 
I share almost entirely the view he offers on nuclear energy and Artificial Intelligence, and that is why I hope that the foundations are in place to carry out the task the government has entrusted itself with. And one of those who is there is the general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who is Argentine and has come to personally support the Plan; which should guarantee IAEA standards and international excellence. Now all that remains is to innovate and specify.

### *The renewed ANP*
*"After decades of decline, nuclear energy will have its triumphant return and we are not going to be left behind, but rather we intend to be pioneers"* is how Reidel began the announcement. 
The cornerstone of the plan is the SMR (Small Modular Reactor) reactors, which are advanced nuclear reactors with a capacity of up to 300MW per unit. They are a fraction of the size of a conventional reactor, and they can be assembled or removed with relative ease, allowing them to be transported throughout the territory.

Their modular nature favors placement in locations where larger units could not be placed and offer unique attributes in terms of efficiency, economy and flexibility; since they could be combined with other renewable energies and increase their efficiency in a hybrid energy system.
Argentina has a patent for an SMR recently developed by INVAP, but the idea is to design a completely new reactor. 
The second stage consists of the development and exploitation of uranium reserves, which are abundant in at least half a dozen provinces and to date the amount of mineral extracted is zero. These will be used to cover all domestic demand mainly in the future, and who tells you that perhaps in the same way as the SMR, to position the country as an exporter of fuel elements with added value.
I think that, as with nuclear energy, at least at the country level, there is a return to recognition that exploiting mineral resources is not bad but on the contrary is beneficial for the economy and development of the country, something that I truly celebrate.

The number of reactors to be built has not been specified, but the conclusion I have reached is that once the Atucha reactor is implemented, they will begin to prepare the provinces, mainly those with a negative or unstable energy balance, to build the facilities required to place the SMRs. I also believe that Patagonia will be prioritized, due to its climatological characteristics and because at the moment, it is positioned as the main candidate for the construction of the data centers and laboratories that are expected to be developed in the coming years in the country. Positioning ourselves as one of the main nations in terms of computing capacity, obviously, this is still a long way off and the roadmap requires that an enormity of issues be finalized first but at least, it is good to aim high. The French Republic has 56 reactors, Argentina should think about at least tying it. Since the 1970s, France has invested heavily in its nuclear infrastructure, allowing it to become one of the world leaders in nuclear energy production, generating approximately 70% of its electricity from this source with a total investment estimated for the construction and modernization of the nuclear park that could reach up to 60,000 million euros.

Most likely, the current government wants to encourage private companies to carry out much of the necessary investment, but to get an idea, let us keep in mind that all Argentine nuclear power plants to date have been powered by Nucleoeléctrica Argentina S.A. and according to the figures presented in the last national budget, it is estimated that energy subsidies account for an expense of 5,000 million USD annually for the National State. With honesty of prices, within 3 presidential terms we would have all the provinces with at least 1 or 2 SMRs. All this taking into account that it is only a minimal part of public spending and knowing that other items could be cut in favor of this idea.

I remain skeptical at first but completely full of hope, so this means technological-scientific advancement and for me personally, I will update as the course of things reveals itself.
