I had to review my notes from the Algorithms and Data Structures course again when I read that supposedly, I repeat, supposedly the new OpenAI o3 model with a mathematical level equivalent to a PhD would have found a polynomial time factoring algorithm. And what does this mean? Well, I'll give you a little context based on my notes from last year.

### *Introduction*
There is a major unsolved problem in computer science that asks if every problem that is easy to verify can also be easy to solve, called the P versus NP problem.
The P problems can be solved in polynomial time, meaning that there is an algorithm that can solve the problem in a number of steps determined by a polynomial function of input size. While NP problems can be verified in polynominal time but may not be easy to solve. The "non-deterministic" part of the name refers to the fact that there is no particular rule for guessing the solution.

The P versus NP problem ask if every NP problem is also a P problem. If the aswer is yes, then it would mean that every problem that is easy to verify can also be easy to solve.

Some of the examples of NP problems are Linear Pprogramming problems, Scheduling tasks, The traveling salesman problem, The minesweeper problem or Tetris.

### *Implications*
This question is of great interest to mathematicians and people who work with computers. The implications in multiple fields of finding a solution to this question, such as computer science, mathematics, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. 

If P = NP many intractable problems would be solvable in polynomial time; Fields such as biotechnology could have significant advances such as the automatic design of drugs for specific purposes or the prediction of protein structures from amino acid sequences. Computer sciences would experience a change in the design of algorithms that would lead to increasing their efficiency exponentially.

One of the issues that generated the most concern among the public was the possible impact on cryptography, since many of these systems are based on the difficulty of certain NP problems, and would be seriously compromised if encryption can be solved efficiently.

The distinction between creativity and verification would blur; If anyone could find solutions as easily as verifying them, it would challenge our understanding of intelligence and creativity.

And all that speculation comes from an article based on some Sam Altman sayings. Yes, the guy who pivots between seeing how much wealth he can add from ClosedAI or the one who spreads fabulous claims which are misfortune later. I d spend last week announcing that they were very very closed to reach AGI and deploy it, and I think we all know what impact this would have if it were true. Then one thing led to another, everything escalated, the model would now have a PhD level in all fields and out of nowhere the issue of the P-NP appears.

Well, today Altman denied everything related to being close to release AGI which implies that everything mentioned above is not true, at least for now. 

Another day in the office for tech fans, maybe this day we still have some filters in front of us that do not allow us to completely undock the exponential technological development that would be expected in a civilization that wishes to advance on the Kardashev scale, but only for the moment.
