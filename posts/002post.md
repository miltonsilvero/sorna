*"The foundation for a new era"* that's how Blue Origin describes New Glenn, named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth. This is the business card of Jeff Bezos who hits the table and joins SpaceX in the space race. 

Founded in 2000 by the bald Bezos, this aerospace company began with a big dream: to build colonies for millions of people that would be in orbit and thus preserve the Earth. And it was in 2005 when they began experimenting with suborbital vehicles capable of taking astronauts to the Kármán line.

Later they focused on the development of low-cost reusable vehicles that could improve safety in manned space flights and later began to offer space tourism services, being great references in this.

The culmination of the first of these points places us in the vehicle that gives its name to this post. From its announcement in 2016 to its first launch a few days ago from Launch Complex 36 at the Kennedy Space Center. This is a two-stage orbital launch vehicle;
- *Reusable first stage (GS1):* with a useful life of about 25 flights and vertical landing similar to the New Shepard and Falcon 9. 
- *Disposable second stage (GS2):* like the GS1, it will use autogenous pressurization (gaseous propellant to keep the propellant used by the engines liquid) and a welded aluminum dome.

In addition, the BE-4 methane/oxygen engines assigned to the GS1 were debuted for the first time in a significant test. And what I mentioned is to give an idea that it took Blue Origin four hours to fill the 98-meter-high launcher with propellants, one of the challenges that caused the suspension of the launch to be withdrawn until two days later than planned after the ice clogged a line that carries gas away from the rocket. Engineers needed to fix that problem so the launch was delayed.

Now you can no longer joke that Blue Origin has never reached orbit, because this rocket crossed the frontier into space demonstrating the great reliability of the GS2's BE-3U engines. Perhaps the only notable drawback that remains from all this is the fact that its booster onto the landing platform, there was no transmission of the moment but it is known that the GS1 did not survive the landing attempt, which is partly good because it will surely make them review all the vehicle processes and now they have something to show investors and thus increase the number of launches this or next year.

It has been noted that they are just entering the playing field in many aspects, but it is excellent that they are company with SpaceX in American aerospace development, such as Northrop Grumman or Rocket Lab, among others, but they are either far behind or are dedicated to other parts of the sector, so the space race between these two private companies could become interesting in 10 years. Especially because it remains to be seen if SpaceX will meet the challenge of sending a Starship to the Moon in the next two years, but little by little I see how the acceleration of space programs worldwide is increasing and it is extremely interesting.  *"We're just getting started"*, said the Blue Origin spokesperson as she signed off the live feed. But why has Blue Origin taken much longer to get here than SpaceX? SpaceX's approach to innovation has been quite different from NASA's or any private sector firm. The norm had been to develop carefully and minimize the risks of a failure when building systems. SpaceX on the other hand have innovated quickly, failed quickly and learned quickly (remember the amount of explosions involved in this).

Furthermore, both Blue Origin and Jeff Bezos came as *"underdogs"* since they were never taken as seriously as Musk, and that is strange knowing the interest that Bezos has had since he was a teenager in space vehicles and his vision of the colonization of the System. Solar. 

They have reached the general public, in addition to the fact that the new Trump government integrates Musk into the cabinet, which is insurance of the American intention regarding space after a long winter. I don't know if I could call it a change of era regarding the subject, but I do know that the times that are coming are promising and everything seems to align so that within a short time the era of the achievements of the 60s and 70s will seem minuscule next to what is known. will achieve, without obviously detracting.

No matter your opinion on the merits of spending billions of dollars on space exploration, it is a spectacular feat of engineering.
